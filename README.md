## Architecture & Safety

MacSweep decouples file discovery from deletion:

```
[ Scanner Engine ] ──▶ [ Safety Validator ] ──▶ [ User Review ] ──▶ [ Confirmed Cleanup ]
```

* **Scanner:** Read-only path enumerator. Cannot delete files.
* **Safety Validator:** Validates candidate paths against system boundaries (`/System`, `/usr`, `/Library/Keychains`) and verifies canonical symlinks.
* **Cleanup Engine:** Permanently removes approved cleaner items. Large Files and App Uninstaller remain recoverable through the macOS Trash.
